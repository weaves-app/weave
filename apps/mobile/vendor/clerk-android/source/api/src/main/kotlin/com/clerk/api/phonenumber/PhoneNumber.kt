/**
 * The `PhoneNumber` object is a model around a phone number entity.
 *
 * Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of
 * contacting users.
 *
 * Phone numbers must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The
 * `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.
 * - The verification process always starts with the `prepareVerification()` method, which will send
 *   a one-time verification code via an SMS message.
 * - The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the
 *   `attemptVerification(code:)` method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.
 *
 * Finally, phone numbers can be used as part of multi-factor authentication. During sign-in, users
 * can opt in to an extra verification step where they will receive an SMS message with a one-time
 * code. This code must be entered to complete the sign-in process.
